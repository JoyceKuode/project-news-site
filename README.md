# News Site

The goal of this project is to create a news/magazine site that adheres to responsive design principles. This project should also demonstrate competency with CSS Flexbox and Grid. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

The first step was to brainstorm a concept for a magazine and then sketch out the basic parts. I looked at many magazine websites to get a feel for what was possible, but in the end decided to keep my design as simple as possible, and then expand from there if time permitted. I used ChatGPT often when I got stuck, and it helped me get quick answers to things like how to create a hover effect. I also referred back to some of the videos from the course material.

## View it live
